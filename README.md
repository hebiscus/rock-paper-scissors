# Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors
Tools used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
<p>What I learned during this project: working with git branches, DOM manipulation.</p>

## Live preview:

## What could be improved:
- images as buttons 
- overall nicer UI 
- when there's a tie couple of times in a row, it looks like nothing is changing
